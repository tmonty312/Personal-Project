            <h1  className="text"> <p className="Q">Where do Puppy Barn puppies come from?</p>
                <p className="a">All our beautiful puppies come from local families! We look for home raised puppies that come from working, hunting, or family pet homes.</p>
                <br/>
                <p> Are all Puppy Barn puppies purebred?</p>
                <p className="a"> We carry many purebred puppies, but we also find homes for many hybrid and cross breed puppies as well. Happy, healthy, and home raised is our criteria! Once a puppy is placed on the Puppy Barn floor they are fully ready to go home with just the right family!</p>
                <br/>
                <p> What is the process of taking a puppy home?</p>
                <p className="a"> All our puppies go home current on their vaccinations and de-worming protection up to date! Each puppy has also undergone a 7 point health inspection as well as having passed viral testing. Once the right puppy has been chosen by a family, one of our expert Barn staff members will walk the new pet owner through the New Puppy Manual and our Health Guarantee Policy. Once the proper care for responsible pet ownership has been explained and understood, then you're ready to take your new best friend home!</p>
                <br/>
                <p> Can I select a Puppy Barn puppy online?</p>
                <p className="a"> Absolutely! We love our out of town Barn guests just as much as our walk-ins! There is a process and fee associated with sending a puppy home with an out of town guest. Air fair and processing average $350, but can fluctuate given breed, age, and size deviations.</p>
                <br/>
                <p> How do I apply at the Puppy Barn?</p>
                <p className="a"> If you would like to join our Puppy Barn family, please apply online by emailing us your resume. You are also welcome to drop by any Puppy Barn location and request an interview with a store manager.</p>
